## Features

Professional LNURL load balancing for your enterprise:

* CLN Lightning Node support with gRPC
* LND Lightning Node support with gRPC
* built on CloudFlare's [Pingora](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora) Load Balancer
* Three balancing algorithms: Round Robin, Random and [Consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_hashing) (Ketama)
* Node health checks redirect invoice requests to healthy nodes
* Self-healing - if an unhealthy node transitions to healthy, it will automatically start taking invoice requests again
* Weighting can shift invoice requests to preferred nodes
* Liquidity biasing with inbound capacity checks will favor nodes most likely to accept payment
* Timed retries with exponential backoff for spurious node failures
* Partitions bind inbound invoice requests to subset of nodes
* Add nodes in seconds with REST Discovery API - new nodes will automatically start taking invoice requests
* Drop nodes in seconds with REST Discovery API - the balancer will safely direct invoices to remaining healthy nodes
* Publish new LNURLs in seconds with Offer API 
* `bech32` and QR code generation endpoints
* Sqlite, MySql and Postgres database support for both Discovery and Offer data stores
* Remote REST stores for both Discovery and Offer

## Status

Switchgear is in **ALPHA** status:

* Critical features are implemented and work as designed
* Integration tests are complete
* APIs may change without warning

See [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md) for the Switchgear release roadmap.

## Why Bitcoin Lightning Payments Fail

### Single Points Of Failure

Failure with a standard LNURL service configuration is highly-probable: 

![image](./doc/sequence_invoice_failure-LNURL_Pay___Invoice_Generation_Failure.png)


### No Liquidity Bias

Single LNURL + Lightning Node deployments make Liquidity Bias impossible. Liquidity bias deprioritizes nodes for invoice requests that have low inbound capacity, which make payment success unlikely.

![image](./doc/sequence_payment_failure-LNURL_Pay___Payment_Failure__Inadequate_Inbound_Liquidity_.png)


### External Load Balancer Resource Exhaustion

Load balancing multiple LNURL instances with a single fixed Lightning Node will  exhaust resources:

* If a node fails, it makes the entire LNURL instance useless
* If a LNURL instance fails, it makes the Lightning Node unreachable
* Duplicating the entire LNURL instance just to attach it to a single Lightning Node raises cost, reducing feasibility of reaching scale
* High latency increases chances of catastrophic retry loop or flooding single node with failover requests

![image](./doc/lnurl-external-balancer.png)

By contrast, every instance of Switchgear in a region can share the Lightning Node fleet, making scale feasible:

* A single Switchgear instance failure does not make a Lightning Node unreachable
* Any Lightning Node failure does not affect the uptime of a Switchgear instance
* Switchgear instances and the Lightning Node fleet size can scale independently, reducing cost
* Health checks are low latency, keeping Lightning Node status accurate
* Internal Backoff runs through entire Backend selection before returning 502 to external balancer, reducing latency and wallet retry cascade

![image](./doc/switchgear-single-region.png)

The internal backoff can be entered under two conditions:

1. No healthy Lightning Nodes are available
2. A Lightning Node spurious failure or node failure between health checks

## Install

The Switchgear binary runs all services as well as the CLI admin interface.

### Host

```shell
cargo install switchgear-server
```

### Docker

The docker file is multi-platform build that targets two platforms:

* linux/amd64
* linux/arm64

Use the `--platform` option to reduce build time if you know your host architecture.

```shell
docker buildx build -t switchgear https://github.com/bitshock-src/switchgear.git --load
```

## Starting Switchgear Services

``` shell
swgr service --config {path/to/config/file} {service enabledment list}
```

The configuration file is in YAML format, and controls settings for all services.

The service enablement list can be any of:

* `lnurl` - the public LNURL service
* `discovery` - the admin discovery service
* `offer` - the offer admin service
* `all` - all services

If left empty, all services will be enabled (same as `all`).

### Docker

To run from Docker:

```shell
docker run {image:tag}
```

The image is configured with a default configuration file path of `/etc/swgr/config.yaml` . Mount a volume on top of `/etc/swgr` to provide your own configuration file.

## Administration

Switchgear can be configured by both the REST API and the CLI.

### REST Administration

Administration Service endpoints:

```
https://{host}/discovery
https://{host}/offers
```

See the [Manage Lightning Node Backends with Discovery Service](#manage-lightning-node-backends-with-discovery-service) and [Manage LNURLs with Offer Service](#manage-lnurls-with-offer-service) sections for complete REST API.

### CLI Administration

```shell
# Manage Lightning Node Backends
swgr discovery
#  Manage LNURLs
swgr offer
```
See the [Manage Lightning Node Backends with Discovery Service](#manage-lightning-node-backends-with-discovery-service) and [Manage LNURLs with Offer Service](#manage-lnurls-with-offer-service) sections for complete CLI manual.

### Docker

To run the CLI administration from Docker:

```shell
docker run {image:tag} {cli-options}
```

## Configuring Switchgear Services

All service configuration is controlled by a yaml file passed to the server at startup.

See [server/config](./server/config) directory for more configuration examples.

Each service has a root entry the configuration file:

```yaml
# LNURL Service Configuration
lnurl-service:
  
# Discovery Service Configuration
discovery-service:

# Offer Service Configuration  
offer-service:
  
# Persistence Settings for Discovery and Offer data  
store:
```

See the service entries below for complete configuration manual.

#### Env Var Shell Expansion

Shell-style env var expansion is supported anywhere in the yaml configuration file.

Example config.yaml:

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  address: "${MY_LNURL_SERVICE_ADDRESS:-127.0.0.1:8080}"
```

Run with:

```shell
MY_LNURL_SERVICE_ADDRESS=192.168.1.100:8080 swgr service --config ./config.yaml
```

The configuration would be parsed as:

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  address: "192.168.1.100:8080"
```

If the env var is unset: 

```shell
swgr service --config ./config.yaml
```

The configuration would be parsed as:

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  address: "127.0.0.1:8080"
```

## Liquidity Bias

Optional Liquidity Bias will prioritize nodes with inbound capacity at the moment of selection. If no nodes are in range of the capacity bias, selection will fall back to standard weight selection.

#### Negative Capacity Bias example (restrictive):

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  selection-capacity-bias: -0.2
```

Invoice request amount must be less than 20% of total inbound capacity of the node to be favored over other nodes that are not.

#### Positive Capacity Bias example (permissive):

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  selection-capacity-bias: 0.1
```

Invoice request amount may be over inbound capacity by up to 10% of the node and still be favored over other nodes that are not.

#### Inbound Capacity Measurement

Capacity is measured in the same cycle as the Lightning Node health check. It is the sum of inbound capacity for all active channels on the node.

## Partitioning

An organization may have a global Offer database. A Switchgear instance may be configured to serve a portion of that database, using partitions. Furthermore, every Lightning Node is configured in Discovery to be bound to a specific partition, insuring payments only land on nodes they belong to.

Each Switchgear instance is configured for the partitions it will serve.

Example:

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  partitions: ["us", "it", "cr"]
```

Only Offers created in "us", "it" or "cr" partitions will be available on the Switchgear instance, even if the Offer exists the database: 

```
https://example.com/offers/us/{id} - 200 success
https://example.com/offers/it/{id} - 200 success 
https://example.com/offers/cr/{id} - 200 success
https://example.com/offers/ca/{id} - 404 not found
```

Each partition must have Discovery Backends configured for the invoice request to succeed.

See the [Manage Lightning Node Backends with Discovery Service](#manage-lightning-node-backends-with-discovery-service) and [Manage LNURLs with Offer Service](#manage-lnurls-with-offer-service) sections for creating Discovery Backends and Offers with partitions.

## Balancing Switchgear

Switchgear itself can be balanced. Balancing multiple switchgear instances within a region:

![image](./doc/switchgear-single-region.png)

For multi-region Global Load Balancer deployment, use the full health check to signal to the downstream balancer that a Switchgear instance has no healthy Lightning Nodes:

```
https://{host}/health/full
```

The full health check will return 500 if no Lightning Nodes are available.

The regional balancer will forward the failing health status to the global balancer, which will send invoice requests to an alternate region:

![image](./doc/switchgear-multi-region.png)

Switchgear partitions have predictable URLs. Use partitions and a global Application Load Balancer to map invoice requests to alternate regions that have Switchgear instances configured for the requested partition.

## LNURL Service

The OpenAPI LNURL Service specification: [doc/lnurl-service-openapi.yaml](./doc/lnurl-service-openapi.yaml).

The LNURL Service is public facing, and implements the [LNURL LUD-06 specification.](https://github.com/lnurl/luds/blob/luds/06.md)

See the [Manage LNURLs with Offer Service](#manage-lnurls-with-offer-service) section for complete service manual.

All Switchgear LNURLs are formatted as:

```
https://{host}/offers/{partition}/{id}
```

Where:

* `partition` - the Offer partition
* `id` - the Offer id (Uuid)

The returned callback is always the LNURL, with the postfix `/invoice` :

```
https://{host}/offers/{partition}/{id}/invoice
```

The bech32 and QR variants are available with:

```
https://{host}/offers/{partition}/{id}/bech32
```

And:

```
https://{host}/offers/{partition}/{id}/bech32/qr
```

The QR image is in PNG format.

### LNURL Service Configuration

See [server/config](./server/config) directory for more configuration examples.

```yaml
lnurl-service:
  # List of partitions this service will handle
  # Partitions allow you to segment different Lightning node groups
  partitions: ["default"]
  
  # Network address and port for the LNURL service to bind to
  address: "127.0.0.1:8080"
  
  # Frequency in seconds for health checking Lightning node backends (float)
  health-check-frequency-secs: 1.0
  
  # Whether to perform health checks in parallel across all backends
  parallel-health-check: true
  
  # Number of consecutive successful health checks needed to mark a backend as healthy
  health-check-consecutive-success-to-healthy: 1
  
  # Number of consecutive failed health checks needed to mark a backend as unhealthy
  health-check-consecutive-failure-to-unhealthy: 1
  
  # Frequency in seconds for updating backend node information (float)
  backend-update-frequency-secs: 1.0
  
  # Invoice expiry time in seconds (integer)
  invoice-expiry-secs: 180
  
  # Timeout in seconds for Lightning node client connections (float)
  ln-client-timeout-secs: 2.0
  
  # List of allowed host headers for incoming requests
  # Used for safely generating callback/invoice URLs.
  allowed-hosts: ["lnurl.example.com"]
  
  # Backoff configuration for retrying failed operations.
  # Backoff is used when Lightning Node invoice request fails.
  backoff:
    # Type of backoff strategy: "stop" or "exponential"
    type: "exponential"
    # Optional: Initial interval in seconds for exponential backoff (float)
    initial-interval-secs: 1.0
    # Optional: Randomization factor (0.0 to 1.0)
    randomization-factor: 0.5
    # Optional: Multiplier for each retry attempt
    multiplier: 2.0
    # Optional: Maximum interval between retries in seconds (float)
    max-interval-secs: 60.0
    # Optional: Maximum total elapsed time before giving up in seconds (float)
    max-elapsed-time-secs: 300.0
  
  # Backend selection strategy for load balancing
  # Options: "round-robin", "random", or "consistent"
  backend-selection: "round-robin"
  # For consistent hashing, specify max iterations (only used with "consistent")
  # backend-selection:
  #   type: "consistent"
  #   max-iterations: 10000
    
  # Optional: Bias factor for capacity-influenced selection
  # Negative values are restrictive:
  # prefer nodes with capacity higher than requested amount
  # Positive values are lenient:
  # refer nodes with capacity less than requested amount  
  selection-capacity-bias: -0.2

  # Optional: Allow &comment query param in LNURL invoice request, sized in char len
  # Used for Consistent backend selection
  comment_allowed: 64,

  # Optional: TLS configuration for HTTPS support
  tls:
    # Path to TLS certificate file
    cert-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/lnurl-cert.pem"
    # Path to TLS private key file
    key-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/lnurl-key.pem"
```

### Consistent Backend-Selection

Consistent uses the optional LNURL `comment` query parameter as a hash key, which guarantees the same node will always receive invoice requests for that key. The balancer will move on to the next closest key match if the node becomes unavailable. This is a specific use-case that provides optimized HTLC settlement between cooperating peers for high-frequency transactions.

## Discovery Service

The OpenAPI Discovery Service specification: [doc/discovery-service-openapi.yaml](./doc/discovery-service-openapi.yaml).

The Discovery Service is an administrative service used to manage connections to individual Lightning Nodes.

The service is isolated from the LNURL Service and can be configured to run on any port. The service supports TLS. Access is protected by a bearer token. Do not run this service without TLS enabled if it is exposed to the public internet.

See the [Manage Lightning Node Backends with Discovery Service](#manage-lightning-node-backends-with-discovery-service) section for complete service manual.

### Discovery Service Configuration

See [server/config](./server/config) directory for more configuration examples.

```yaml
discovery-service:
  # Network address and port for the Discovery service to bind to
  address: "127.0.0.1:8081"
  
  # Path to the authentication authority certificate/key file
  # This file contains the public key used to verify API access
  auth-authority: "/etc/ssl/certs/discovery-auth-authority.pem"
  
  # Optional: TLS configuration for HTTPS support
  tls:
    # Path to TLS certificate file
    cert-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/discovery-cert.pem"
    # Path to TLS private key file
    key-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/discovery-key.pem"
```

#### Authentication Setup

Generate key pairs and tokens for Discovery service authentication:

```shell
# Generate a new key pair for token signing
swgr discovery token key --public discovery-public.pem --private discovery-private.pem

# The public key (discovery-public.pem) should be used as the auth-authority in the configuration
# The private key (discovery-private.pem) is used to mint authentication tokens
```

## Offer Service

The OpenAPI Offer Service specification: [doc/offer-service-openapi.yaml](./doc/offer-service-openapi.yaml).

The Offer Service is an administrative service used to manage Offers, which are used to generate LNURLs.

The service is isolated from the LNURL Service and can be configured to run on any port. The service supports TLS. Access is protected by a bearer token. Do not run this service without TLS enabled if it is exposed to the public internet.

See the [Manage LNURLs with Offer Service](#manage-lnurls-with-offer-service) section for complete service manual.

### Offer Service Configuration

See [server/config](./server/config) directory for more configuration examples.

```yaml
offer-service:
  # Network address and port for the Offers service to bind to
  address: "127.0.0.1:8082"
  
  # Path to the authentication authority certificate/key file
  # This file contains the public key used to verify API access
  auth-authority: "/etc/ssl/certs/offer-auth-authority.pem"
  
  # Optional: TLS configuration for HTTPS support
  tls:
    # Path to TLS certificate file
    cert-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/offer-cert.pem"
    # Path to TLS private key file
    key-path: "/etc/ssl/certs/offer-key.pem"
```

#### Authentication Setup

Generate key pairs and tokens for Offer service authentication:

```shell
# Generate a new key pair for token signing
swgr offer token key --public offer-public.pem --private offer-private.pem

# The public key (offer-public.pem) should be used as the auth-authority in the configuration
# The private key (offer-private.pem) is used to mint authentication tokens
```

## Persistence

Both Discovery and Offer services support multiple storage backends. Configure persistence in the `store` section of your configuration file.

### Common Storage Types

Both Discovery and Offer stores support these storage backends:

#### Database Storage (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)

```yaml
store:
  discover:  # or 'offer'
    type: "database"
    # Database connection URL (SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL)
    database-url: "connection-url"
    # Maximum number of concurrent database connections
    max-connections: 5
```

For `database-url` formats, see [Database Connection URLs](#database-connection-urls).

#### HTTP Storage (Remote Service)

Both Discovery and Offer can use a remote http store, making custom integrations straightforward. The store clients connect to the same REST API used for remote administration, making it possible for Switchgear to run headless as well, serving only as a database for other Switchgear instances.

```yaml
store:
  discover:  # or 'offer'
    type: "http"
    # Base URL of the remote service
    base-url: "https://service.example.com"
    # Timeout in seconds for establishing connection
    connect-timeout-secs: 2.0
    # Total timeout in seconds for complete request/response
    total-timeout-secs: 5.0
    # List of trusted CA certificate paths for TLS verification
    trusted-roots: ["/etc/ssl/certs/ca.pem"]
    # Path to bearer token file for authentication
    authorization: "/etc/ssl/certs/auth.token"
```

#### In-memory Storage

Volatile storage, data is lost on restart:

```yaml
store:
  discover:  # or 'offer'
    type: "memory"
```

### Discovery File Storage

The Discovery store supports an additional file-based storage option:

```yaml
store:
  discover:
    type: "file"
    # Directory path where backend JSON files will be stored
    storage-dir: "/data/discovery_backends"
```

This stores each backend configuration as a separate JSON file in the specified directory.

### Configuration Examples

#### Using Same Database for Both Stores

```yaml
store:
  # Discovery backend storage
  discover:
    type: "database"
    database-url: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/switchgear"
    max-connections: 5
  
  # Offer storage (sharing same database)
  offer:
    type: "database"
    database-url: "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/switchgear"
    max-connections: 10
```

#### Mixed Storage Types

```yaml
store:
  # File-based storage for Discovery
  discover:
    type: "file"
    storage-dir: "/var/lib/switchgear/discovery"
  
  # Database storage for Offers
  offer:
    type: "database"
    database-url: "sqlite:///var/lib/switchgear/offers.db?mode=rwc"
    max-connections: 5
```

#### Remote Service Configuration

```yaml
store:
  # Connect to remote Discovery service
  discover:
    type: "http"
    base-url: "https://discovery.internal:8081"
    connect-timeout-secs: 2.0
    total-timeout-secs: 5.0
    trusted-roots: ["/etc/ssl/certs/internal-ca.pem"]
    authorization: "/etc/ssl/certs/discovery.token"
  
  # Local database for Offers
  offer:
    type: "database"
    database-url: "sqlite:///data/offers.db?mode=rwc"
    max-connections: 10
```

### Database Connection URLs

Both Discovery and Offer data stores have a `database-url` field to configure the database.

### Sqlite

```
sqlite:///path/to/file.db?{options}
```

See [https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html](https://www.sqlite.org/uri.html) for all connection URL options.

## Manage Lightning Node Backends With Discovery Service

The Discovery Service manages Lightning Node backends that connect to Switchgear for invoice requests. The service supports dynamic registration, updates, enablement and removal of CLN and LND nodes.

The Discovery Service can be administered with both REST and the CLI.

To get started quickly, use the CLI to write a new JSON data model template to a file:

```shell
# Generate a template backend configuration
swgr discovery new cln-grpc --output cln-backend.json
swgr discovery new lnd-grpc --output lnd-backend.json
````

### REST API

The Discovery Service provides a REST API for backend management. All endpoints except `/health` require bearer token authentication.

#### Authentication

First, generate a token:
```shell
# Create a token (expires in 3600 seconds)
# Note: Requires private key from Authentication Setup (see Discovery Service Configuration)
swgr discovery token mint --key discovery-private.pem --expires 3600 --output discovery.token

# Set authorization header for curl commands
export AUTH_TOKEN=$(cat discovery.token)
```

#### Register A New Backend

```shell
# Register a CLN node
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/discovery \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "partition": "default",

      }
    }
  }'

# Register an LND node
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/discovery \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "partition": "default",
    "address": {
      "url": "https://lnd-node.example.com"
    },
    "weight": 50,
    "enabled": true,

        "macaroonPath": "/path/to/admin.macaroon"
      },
      "ampInvoice": false
    }
  }'
```

#### List All Backends In A Partition

```shell
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/discovery/default \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
```

#### Get A Specific Backend

```shell
# By public key
curl -X GET "http://localhost:3001/discovery/default/pk/0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798" \

        "clientKeyPath": "/path/to/client-key.pem"
      }
    }
  }'
```

#### Delete A Backend

```shell
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:3001/discovery/default/pk/0279be667ef9dcbbac55a06295ce870b07029bfcdb2dce28d959f2815b16f81798" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN"
```

#### Health Check

```shell
# No authentication required
curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

### CLI

The `swgr discovery` command provides the same functionality as the REST interface for remote management of Lightning Node backends.

## Manage LNURLs With Offer Service

The Offer service manages Lightning payment offers and their metadata. It provides storage and retrieval of LNURL Pay offers with configurable payment limits and display information.

The Offer Service can be administered with both REST and the CLI.

To get started quickly, use the CLI to write a new JSON data model template to a file:

```shell
# Generate a template offer configuration
swgr offer new --output offer-template.json

# Generate a template metadata configuration
swgr offer metadata new --output metadata-template.json
````

### LNURL

An Offer has two fields that combine to create a unique identifier:

* `partition`
* `id` (Uuid)

Both fields are used to make the final public LNURL:

```
https://{host}/offers/{partition}/{id}
```


### REST API

The Offer service provides a REST API for offer and metadata management. All endpoints except `/health` require bearer token authentication.

#### Authentication

First, generate a token:
```shell
# Create a bearer token (expires in 3600 seconds)
# Note: Requires private key from Authentication Setup (see Offer Service Configuration)
swgr offer token mint --key offer-private.pem --expires 3600 --output offer.token

# Set authorization header for curl commands
export AUTH_TOKEN=$(cat offer.token)
```

#### Create A New Offer

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/offers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "partition": "default",
    "id": "6a38ebdd-83ef-4b94-b843-3b18cd90a833",
    "maxSendable": 1000000,
    "minSendable": 1000,
    "metadataId": "88deff7e-ca45-4144-8fca-286a5a18fb1a",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "expires": "2024-12-31T23:59:59Z"
  }'
```
